unit movement ai
================
There are two states: MOVING and IDLE.

In the MOVING state, the unit will try to reach their target on the path queue.
If the unit reaches their target, then they switch to the idle state. The
iterateOverPath() method will check if they still have more of the path to go,
then switches them back to the MOVING state. If the unit keeps colliding with
other units, or the world, then they will move in a random direction to let
other units pass by them. The MAX_COLLISIONS variable determines how quickly
they do this, and the RANGE variable determines how far they move in that
random direction.

In the idle state, they let other units push them around as a simple solution
for now.

squad movement ai
=================
This is very simple. There is only one method: moveTo. This method will generate
a position for every unit in the squad nearby the mouse click. The idea is
for the units to end up in a square, with the middle of the square being
centered onto the mouse position. After the positions are generated, it simply
tells the unit to move to the position.

if you have 9 units, m is where the mouse is clicked (and where a unit will
end up) and u is a unit.
u u u
u m u
u u u
