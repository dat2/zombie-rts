swarm path finding
==================
a swarm is a collection of units. The AI for the swarm stores a single path,
and just tells each unit to move in the general direction between nodes on the
path. if units movement will cause them to collide, units will move in a
different direction until they don't collide, or stop, whichever is "better".
