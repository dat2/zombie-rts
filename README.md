zombie-rts
=========

A JavaScript next zombie RTS game. Trello board is
[here](https://trello.com/b/l5yqHRK9/zombie-rts) but this is not public.
I shall eventually create a publicly readable google docs with the game design.

to run the game locally, do the following:

1. install nodejs
2. run `npm install -g bower gulp`
3. clone this repo
4. `npm install && bower install` in the root directory of this repo
5. `gulp serve` then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Currently using browser-sync because its the only one that seemed to work with livereload :/
6. code :D
